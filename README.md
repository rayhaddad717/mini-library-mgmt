# Features


The project was built with NextJS for both frontend and backend, with mongodb as the database.

## Frontend:
- Ability to create and edit books
- Demo user portal where they can search for books and view them

## Backend:
- Ability to create and edit books
- Ability to soft delete books
- Ability to borrow a book and return it


## Future Plans:
Implement authentication middleware for admin APIs.
Use mongo atlas for the database/ or vercel hosted mongodb.

AI additions: create a basic AI chat window that will have the book context in the book page for the user.
The user can ask about the book and based on that the AI can recommend similar books.
